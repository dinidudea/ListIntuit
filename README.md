# ListIntuit
A quick and easy text to speech app using Google's TTS API and studio voices.

Replace the credentials/google_credentials.json with your Google API credentials and run. You can use <a href=https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials>this guide</a> to create your own credentials. It's not free, but it only will cost you a few cents unless you're doing text-to-speech at an industrial level.
